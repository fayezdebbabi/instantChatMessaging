# instantChatMessaging
This project contains different files, the serveur_stable.py file is the server for the instantChatMessaging project, client_stable.py file is the client (we can execute as many clients as we want), socerr.py file is used in both client_stable.py and serveur_stable.py files in order to simulate a real channel loss using a variable that represents the probability of the tranmission success.
Every detail about how the project works, is mentioned in the specification document "Spécification_à_suivre.pdf".
The "Fayez-DEBBABI-FATIMA-EZZAHRA-ELAAMRAOUI.pdf" file is a possible specification for this application that i did with another person during the project.
